# PsychoBean
An engaging and dynamic game experience, "PsychoBean" immerses players in a continuous, 
high-stress environment where the primary objective is to skillfully navigate a jumping bean towards a target wall
while avoiding collision with obstacles such as pipes and the ground.
By providing an interactive platform for players, 
this game serves as a valuable tool for anger management.
